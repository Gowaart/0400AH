90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was edited together with Ibn Bābawayh's Thawāb al-aʿmāl;
    PV separated these two texts (see 0381IbnBabawayh.ThawabAcmal.Shia001138A-ara1)
    1- HRH used a different edition for collation. This
    edition has a few extra titles ("bāb"). HRH indicated them with blank headers since
    they are useful for the structure of the text. 
    2- Two other editions of the text that are
    accessible on the internet can be found here:
    http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2100 and
    http://alfeker.net/library.php?id=2542.
